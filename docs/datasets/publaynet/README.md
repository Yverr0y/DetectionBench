# PubLayNet: Dataset Statistics

## About

PubLayNet is a large-scale document layout analysis benchmark: 335,703 training / 11,245 validation page images automatically annotated by matching the PDF and XML representations of over 1 million PubMed Central Open Access articles, across five layout element types. It's used to benchmark document layout detection at a scale few manually-annotated datasets can match.

Computed from the canonical COCO layout produced by `detectionbench-prepare-coco --dataset publaynet`. See the adapter and Hydra config for how these splits are built.

## Split Summary

No local copy has been prepared yet -- the full release is 100GB+ (see `dataset_cards/publaynet/README.md` for third-party re-upload links), so this project has deliberately not downloaded/converted it. The published splits are:

| Split | Images |
| :--- | ---: |
| train | 335,703 |
| val | 11,245 |
| test | 11,405 (unlabeled -- ICDAR 2021 competition set, not converted) |

Once staged and run through `detectionbench-prepare-coco --dataset publaynet`, regenerate this report with real per-class/per-box numbers via the command at the bottom of this file.

## Class Distribution

Not available yet (no local data). Classes: `text`, `title`, `list`, `table`, `figure`.
